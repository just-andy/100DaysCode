                2020 was hard for everyone in several different ways. Although I was fortunate enough to still be employed I did find frustations towards the end of the year.

            <p class="py-6">I identified that I had lost the mental stimulation of learning. Although I work in code as part of my day job I wasn't taking the time to learn all the courses or tutorials I'd bookmarked. I took <a href="https://mastergatsby.com/" title="Wes Bos Master Gatsby Course" target="_blank" rel="external" >Wes Bos "Master Gatsby"</a> course and realised the challenge of learning and problem solving was what I needed for my mental health. </p>

            <p class="py-6">This loooong list is my notes on what I tackled on my <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" title="100 Days of Code" target="_blank" rel="external">#100DaysofCode</a>.</p>

                    <p>A day battling the dropdown component, that eventually because larger that expected.One new feature I learned about with stopPropogation and how it differs from eventPrevent default.</p>
                    <p>I also came across some great explanations about how JS works from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theavocoder/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="external"></a>Lydia Hallie on her Instagram</a>. Worth checking out as some great visuals to explain the core concepts in JS and Git.</p>

                    <p>React heavy day building a dropdown component for a Gatsby site. Required some help from one of our senior Developers and the used useEffect and useRef for the solution. Realise I need to a bit more research and understanding on these two things. Some of the resources I used to learn are below.</p>

                <dd>
                    <p>Focused on figuring out how Gatsby theme shadowing works and the benefits over rolling my own. Still getting to grips with it but can time saving not having to write Graph_ql.</p>
                    <p>Found this official video <a href="https://youtu.be/Ycnso8BqEyc" rel="external" target="_blank">Gatsby Tutorial: Exploring Blog Theme 2.0</a> from <a href="https://laurieontech.com/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Laurie Barth">Laurie Barth</a> really useful. Fills in the blocks missing from the docs.</p>

                    <p>After playing around and even trying to go to gatsby-theme-blog-core I realised I was spending more time altering shadow paths than building. I've built up my own little whitelabel in gatsby and Tailwind already and become effective at that.</p>
                    <p>I opted to roll my own and take learnings from Wes Bos's recent course and focus more on learning to apple Typescript to React. Typescript is used in my day job with components and Figma so it seems like a better use of my time in then next 90 days to focus on that path.</p>

                    <p>Been enjoying taking notes and writing about what I've learned so thought I'd use that as a catalyst to expand my Gatsby JS knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Despite building a few sites in Gatsby now I've falled behind on their themes, Theme UI and recipes. Today I focused on getting a Gatsby site running locally with Theme UI and Tailwind Preset.</p>
                    <p>This tutorial from <a href="https://hashinteractive.com/blog/how-to-use-theme-ui-tailwind-css-preset/" target="_blank" title="Hash Interactive Theme UI tutorial">Hash Interactive</a> helped get the Tailwind and Theme UI rolling.</p>

                    <p>Brought back to reality on how much I really know about JS after completing day 4, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB1ZC7czKRs" target="_blank" rel="external">Array Cardio 1</a>, of Wes Bos Javascript 30 course. </p>
                    <p>First couple of excercies around <b>.map</b> i did ok with but when it got into reduce and sort I was totally lost. I tried to do the challenged myself only using Moz Docs for help but I was way off. This is a workout I'll need to take a few times over.</p>
                    <p>I plan to jump back to the Wes Box Beginner 30 course and a few vanilla JS articles I bookmarked before trying out anymore of the JS 30 course.</p>

                   <p>Really short one today as I mainly focused on getting this site together. Went for straight HTML and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> to get up and running.</p>
                   <p>I played around with Github pages but realised it was overkill for what I needed.</p>

                   <p>I've been having trouble making a React Navigation with multiple dropdowns. To focus my efforts I set up a codesandbox to get focus on getting the issue. Still needs finished off but its a start.
