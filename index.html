                2020 was hard for everyone in several different ways. Although I was fortunate enough to still be employed I did find frustations towards the end of the year.

            <p class="py-6">I identified that I had lost the mental stimulation of learning. Although I work in code as part of my day job I wasn't taking the time to learn all the courses or tutorials I'd bookmarked. I took <a href="https://mastergatsby.com/" title="Wes Bos Master Gatsby Course" target="_blank" rel="external" >Wes Bos "Master Gatsby"</a> course and realised the challenge of learning and problem solving was what I needed for my mental health. </p>

            <p class="py-6">This loooong list is my notes on what I tackled on my <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" title="100 Days of Code" target="_blank" rel="external">#100DaysofCode</a>.</p>

                   <p>Really short one today as I mainly focused on getting this site together. Went for straight HTML and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> to get up and running.</p>
                   <p>I played around with Github pages but realised it was overkill for what I needed.</p>

                   <p>I've been having trouble making a React Navigation with multiple dropdowns. To focus my efforts I set up a codesandbox to get focus on getting the issue. Still needs finished off but its a start.
                       
                    Watched tutorials around <a href="https://youtu.be/t2ypzz6gJm0" target="_blank" rel="external"></a> React useRef from Web Development Made Simple.</p>

                    <p>Create a <a href="https://github.com/just-andy/100DaysCode" target="blank" rel="external">new git repo for CRA, Tailwind and Wes Bos EsLint code</a> for Future projects that I can fork and start from.</p>

                    <p>Refactored a lot of Gatsby code on our Design System website.</p>
                    <p>Included <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos" target="_blank" rel="external">Wes Bos's ES Lint and Prettier</a> on the project to start cleaning up the bad coding. I've found this approach really useful after using the setup in his courses.</p>

                    <p>Really great course, can't recommend it enough. Most other Gatsby courses cover the basics but this goes to a higher level working with Sanity, Netlify functions and more.</p>

This was a great episode that covered set up and the basics with examples. TS is something I really hope to get to grips with in these 100 days so it was a great primer.</p>
